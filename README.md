    I am originally from Gurnee, a suburb about an hour north of Chicago. This is my third year 
    at UIC and I plan to graduate next May. I have an interest in machine learning and artificial 
    intelligence. I am currently the Mars Rover Electronics & Programming lead for the AIAA chapter 
    at UIC, where we are designing a small rover to be launched in a suborbital rocket which will 
    drive on a path, drop markers, and transmit telemetry and images back to the ground station.
